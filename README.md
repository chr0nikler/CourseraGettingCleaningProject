This is the README file for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The one script that needs to be run is *run_analysis.R*

Note that the first line of the script

```r
setwd("~/Documents/Dev/R/CourseraCleaningData/CourseProject/")
```
should be changed to fit the needs of the user. The working directory should be set
such that the first folder below it is the *UCI HAR Dataset* folder

The code book for this repo can be found [HERE](https://github.com/abcde13/CourseraGettingCleaningProject/blob/master/CodeBook.md)
