This is the README file for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The one script that needs to be run is *run_analsysi.R*

Note that the first line of the script

```r
setwd("~/Documents/Dev/R/CourseraCleaningData/CourseProject/")
```
Should be changed to fit the needs of the user. The working direct should be set
such that the first folder below it is the *UCI HAR Dataset* folder
